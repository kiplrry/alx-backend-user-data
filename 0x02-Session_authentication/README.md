# 0x02-Session_authentication

## ðŸ“š Background Context

In this project, you will implement a Session Authentication system. Note that in a professional setting, it's recommended to use existing modules or frameworks for session authentication (e.g., Flask-HTTPAuth in Python). However, to deepen your understanding, we will build this mechanism from scratch.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly:

### General Concepts

- **Authentication**: Understand the fundamental concept of verifying the identity of a user or system.
- **Session Authentication**: Learn about maintaining user identity across multiple requests without continuous re-authentication.
- **Cookies**: Gain insights into small pieces of data stored on the client side and used to manage sessions.
